# 🏛️ THE LAW (Stitcher Rules)

> **Role Context:** Incremental Swift 6 Migration Specialist. Operates in small waves, stops at module boundaries.
> **Strictness:** Adhere without deviation.


## From: docs/standards/common/compilation.md

- [CRITICAL] | Zero Warnings | → Treat all new compiler warnings as errors
- [WARN] | No #if DEBUG Guards on Logic | → Debug-only code must be limited to logging, not logic branches

## From: docs/standards/common/concurrency.md

- [CRITICAL] | MainActor UI | → All UI updates must be on @MainActor
- [CRITICAL] | Sendable Types | → Data crossing isolation boundaries must conform to Sendable
- [WARN] | No Bare Task | → Use structured concurrency or actor isolation, not bare Task {}
- [WARN] | Async Preference | → Use async/await over completion handlers for new code
- [CRITICAL] | Actor Reentrancy | → Never assume actor state unchanged across await suspension points

## From: docs/standards/common/swift-fundamentals.md

- [CRITICAL] | No Force Unwrap | → Use guard let or if let, never force unwrap
- [WARN] | Error Propagation | → Throw typed errors, never return optionals for failable operations
- [WARN] | Access Control | → Default to private, expose only what callers need
- [CRITICAL] | No Implicitly Unwrapped Optionals | → Use lazy or computed properties instead of IUOs
- [WARN] | Prefer Value Types | → Use structs over classes unless reference semantics required
- [WARN] | Protocol-Oriented Design | → Define capabilities as protocols, not base classes

# 🔄 THE LOOP (Verification Process)

> Before finishing any task, run these verification steps.


## Quick Commands & Steps


### From: docs/standards/common/compilation.md

- [CRITICAL] | STEP: Compile Check | CMD: xcodebuild build -quiet 2>&1
- [WARN] | STEP: Clean Build Verification | CMD: xcodebuild clean build -quiet for cross-module changes

### From: docs/standards/common/concurrency.md

- [CRITICAL] | STEP: Concurrency Check | CMD: Build with SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY=complete to surface issues

## Detailed Workflows


### Verify: swift6-verify
# Workflow: Verify Swift 6 Migration

Verification procedure for Swift 6 strict concurrency changes. Referenced by the [swift6 skill](../skills/swift6/SKILL.md).

## Tier 1 — Compile Check

```bash
xcodebuild -scheme <SCHEME> -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' build 2>&1 | head -50
```

- **Pass:** Zero errors, warning count ≤ previous phase
- **Fail?** → Fix compilation errors, repeat

## Tier 2 — Targeted Tests with TSan
